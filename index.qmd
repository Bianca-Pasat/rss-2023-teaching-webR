## Teaching statistics with R


## What is webR?

- [webR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/)

- Run R code in a web browser

  - no installation required
  
  - no server required
  
## Try it!

[teaching-with-webr.netlify.app](https://teaching-with-webr.netlify.app/)

```{webr-r}
# set a random seed and generate data
set.seed(123)
x <- rnorm(100)

# calculate mean
mean(x)
```

## How can we use webR for teaching?

## Is it difficult to build?

## Example

```{webr-r}
# calculate confidence interval
signif <- 0.95
ci <- confint(lm(x ~ 1), level = signif)

# plot
hist(x)
abline(v = c(ci[1], mean(x), ci[2]), col=c("blue", "red", "blue"), lwd = 2)
```
